# Boilerplate Shopify Theme

Simple boilerplate for Shopify theme development (as of 2020). I had to reverse-engineer to understand how Shopify wants the file structure because it seems Shopify's Slate is no longer maintained. What is the future of Shopify theme development without Slate?

## Requirements

This is what I use for development on macOS Mojave v10.14.6\. Compass, the Sass compiler, has not been supported since the spring of 2018 however it still works as of the spring of 2020\. So use at your own risk. However it suited my purposes perfectly.

- Shopify developer account
- Demo store set up
- Homebrew, Xcode, Ruby...
- [Shopify Theme Kit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/)
- [Compass, Sass compiler](http://compass-style.org/help/)

## Instructions

Follow download instructions for packages.

In a terminal window type

`theme watch`

In another terminal window type

`compass watch`
